<p><b>Date: 19th October 2015</b></p>

<p>Everyone seemed really excited when Mr Francisco , our trainer for the Pre Fab Academy started the class by giving the classical examples of What Digital Fabrication is all about. Important refernces were made to The Mathematical Theory of Communication and The Third Industrial Revolution, an article published in The Economist. 

Francisco then introduced himselves, and told his journey from being a Civil Engineering and how he got interest in Fab Academy. He then explained the projects that he did in his fab lab, The Beach Lab and the 9 principles of MIT Media Labs.

Pre fab academy is the stepping stone towards the Fab Academy course and wherein all the topics are covered from its basics. The method of evaluation of performance in the pre fab academy is based on the overall performance in the course and on the way you document.

Day 2: From Windows to Ubuntu (the unexpected plunge)

Date : 20th October 2015

For the Pre Fab Academy it is essential to keep a seperate note book for writing down all the points during the course of the workshop. It is insisted to use the same notebook if you are attending the fab academy. The documentation shall be done in such a way that in case of doing a machine operation
Name of the work
Name of the machine
Spec
Settings
Measurements (if any)

Having never used ubuntu before, when Fracisco asked to install Ubuntu, it was like What should i do with it. 
My Laptop Specs:
Model: Dell Inspiron 
Processor: Intel® Core™ i5-3210M CPU @ 2.50GHz × 4 with 4 GB RAM

Installing Ubuntu 14.04
The important thing before installation of Ubuntu is to create partitions in the available harddisk space by opening Manange -> Computer Management-> Storage and you can see the way how your hardisk is divided into various partitions. My hardisk had 6 partitions and i merged 2 drives which had free space resulting in a new space with 160GB. 
After plugging in the pendrive with Ubuntu 14.04 restart the computer. Press F12 and get into Boot Settings. 
Navigate through the top menu bar and you can find 

Legacy Boot [Enable]
[Disable]
Press F10 and Save. 

Ubuntu opens up next objective is to create three partitions namely /, /home, and swap area. 

For / 
Memory : Primary
Ext 24
Allocate space as per your choice (50 GB)

For /homee
Memory: logical
Ext 24
Space allocated: 100 GB

For swap area
Space allocated: 4 GB

Install Ubuntu

Once you have completed installing ubuntu, update the OS by opening the Terminal (Ctrl+alt+t). 

apt-get update 

If this shows permission denied use the below command

sudo apt-get update (sudo means super user do)

Once you have successfully updated Ubuntu, the next step is to download the dependencies and for which log on to kokompe.cba.mit.edu

Once that is done next step is to download the fab modules


Unzip the fab module,open the folder, right click select open terminal here.
If you couldnt find it you need to install nautilus (file manager)

sudo apt-get install nautilus

Install fab modules

Then downlaod kokopelli.retro.zip (shared by francisco)
extract
make fab
cd bin
./kokopelli

Download antimony

Search github antimony
Open

Intall Qt5 (an application, where in you can design software by placing buttons and corresponding codes are generated simultaneously)

Install the following

Clone antimony (for getting the antimony updated automatically)

~/Qt5.4.0/5.4/gcc_64/bin/qmake ../sb.pro
sudo make -j8
./app/antimony


Antimony is not getting installed in my computer and  i am finding errors for the same
