<h1>Week 2: Getting acquainted with the Machines</h1>
And from today onwards everything is on Ubuntu!!!
<p><b>Day 5: The Vinyl Cutter</b></p>
The Vinyl Cutter that our fablab has is Roland GX-24 , CAMM-1 SERVO vinyl cutter 2" - 27.5"5.08cm - 69.85cm 20 IPS 30gf - 250gf. Vinyl Cutter
A vinyl cutter is a type of computer controlled machine. Small vinyl cutters look like computer printers. The computer controls the movement of a sharp blade. This blade is used to cut out shapes and letters from sheets of thin self-adhesive plastic (vinyl).
A symbol / label can be produced using a Vinyl Cutter such as a ‘Sticker Machine’ or a ‘Craftrobo’. These machines are controlled by a computer and operate similar to a printer. Essentially they cut out shapes in adhesive vinyl. The vinyl can then be stuck onto almost any surface.
Today’s Assignment: Create a sticker using the vinyl cutter.
Francisco started today’s class by giving an introduction to vinyl cutting. The first step was to connect my laptop with the printer. Fab academy do not recommend using drivers for printing instead use fab modules. So for connecting the printer with my PC log on to http://localhost:631 . This led me to a website named CUPS (C UNIX Printing Systems).

 Franc then gave us a detailed instruction the machining part. 
Vinyl Printer Pic 1
He unloaded the lever behind the printer and inserted the vinyl sheet. The sheet while loading should be aligned to grooves. The sheet when placed on the machine has to be between any two  white markings seen in the front. Load the cutting blade to the printer.
The printer has an instrument cluster as shown.

Select the type of vinyl  used for printing whether it is a sheet, piece or roll.  to the machine and The keys are used for navigating the cutting head . Using the navigation button move the head towards the point from where the cut has to begin. He moved it accordingly and pressed the origin button. Now the machine considers this as the origin. Now he pressed the test button. This performed a test cut in the vinyl. A square within a circle. The objective of this test is that the user should be able to peel of the circle without removing the square. This ensures that the blades are sharp enough and the applied pen force is sufficient. 
Franc for demonstration gave a test cut. It did made the cut, but when tried to peel off the circle, the square also got peeled off.

Here the blade before replacing was viewed under a microscope. Franc showed the blade having blunt edges that resulted in undistributed cut in the vinyl.
<br><b>Advice: Always try to figure out the problem that led to the error.</b>

So  now its time to cut my design. So the design I am having is an ambigram. 
One thing you need to keep in mind is that the design should have minimum 500 dpi ie when
converted to pixels it should be more than 2000 * 2000 pixels and should be in black and white. The reason being that only then the vinyl recognizes the borders/boundaries correctly.
