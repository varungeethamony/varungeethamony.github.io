<h1>Week 3: The Electronics Week</h1>
<p><b>Day 10:Into the Electronics Week</b></p>
<p>The Electronics and Programming Is one of the core part in the fab academy programme and through  the pre fab academy our trainers are trying to introduce us to the basics. Being a Civil Engineer Francisco told us how he started learning electronics and how he mastered it. It was really an inspiration for me as I had the fear of whether I would be able to catch up with others. If I quote Francisco “Electronics is not a one step process. It is a permanent learning process. Depth is infinite The more you give the more you obtain”.</p>
So todays assignment is to Fabricate the Fab ISP. The participants were divided into group of 2. Myself and Vinod Kumar . Before starting off with the fabrication Francisco showed us how to prepare the Roland Modela bed and the sacrificial layer. 
 <p><b>Preparing the modela bed</b></p>
Remove the modela bed from the milling machine. Place a single side copper circuit board carefully towards one side of the bed and stick it firmly to the bed using double sided tapes. So this forms the Sacrificial layer . Then he took the circuit board which is used for milling and on the rear side of the board he applied the double sided tapes. One thing to be made sure is that there shouldn’t be air bubbles once you place the tape. Carefully place the circuit board on top of the sacrificial layer and ensure that there are no gaps in between. A slight change in the board position causes notable difference in the circuit.  Now you are ready to mill.
